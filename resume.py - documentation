##  breakdown of the functions each with a brief interpretation of its purpose: 

PDF Text Extraction (get_pdf_text):
Purpose: Extracts text from PDF documents.
Methodology: Iterates through each PDF document and each page within, using PdfReader to extract text.
  
Text Chunking (get_text_chunks):
Purpose: Splits extracted text into manageable chunks.
Methodology: Uses CharacterTextSplitter to split text based on character count, managing overlap to ensure continuity in data.

Vector Store Creation (get_vectorstore):
Purpose: Converts text chunks into a vector space model.
Methodology: Utilizes OpenAIEmbeddings for embedding text and FAISS to create a vector store from these embeddings, facilitating efficient similarity searches.
                                      
Conversation Chain Setup (get_conversation_chain):
Purpose: Establishes a conversation chain for AI-based text interaction.
Methodology: Configures a ConversationalRetrievalChain using the previously created vector store, an instance of ChatOpenAI, and a memory buffer to manage dialogue context.
                                   
Recursive Text Splitting (split_text):
Purpose: Splits large text into smaller sections recursively for detailed analysis.
Methodology: Uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for deep text division, suitable for complex documents.
                                                
Load Large Language Model (load_LLM):
Purpose: Loads a pre-trained language model.
Methodology: Instantiates a ChatOpenAI model with specific parameters (like temperature and API key), ready for generating responses or performing tasks.
                                                
Interactive Web Application Setup:
Purpose: Provides a user interface to upload PDFs and request tasks like resume analysis or cover letter generation.
Methodology: Uses streamlit to create an interactive web app where users can upload files and receive AI-generated text based on the content of the PDFs.
